# Bureau of Acceptable Views

A lightweight camera addon for *The Elder Scrolls Online*. It gives you back
control over the third-person camera in situations where the game normally
takes it away, and layers a few optional cinematic touches on top. Dynamic FOV
is on out of the box for an eased zoom feel; everything else stays out of your
way until you turn it on.

> **Compatibility:** API: LIVE 101050 / PTS 101050 · Optional: LibAddonMenu-2.0 (>= 43)
> for the settings panel, and LibSprint for bind-independent sprint detection.

## What it does

The core feature is **free zoom in restricted states**. ESO locks the camera
to a fixed distance (or forces first person) in certain situations. This addon
lets you zoom freely between maximum zoom and first person in those states,
with optional persistence so your framing survives zone changes and relogs.

On top of that, two **optional** systems can shape the camera further. Dynamic
FOV is enabled by default (it does nothing on clients where the FOV property is
unsupported); context presets stay disabled until you switch them on.

## Features

### Free zoom in restricted states
- Zoom anywhere between max zoom and first person while the game would normally
  lock the camera.
- Configurable persistence: keep your zoom across zone changes and logins, or
  let it reset — your choice.
- Controller input safely falls back to the game's default camera handling, so
  nothing breaks if you play on a gamepad.

### Dynamic FOV *(optional, on by default)*
- Ties your third-person field of view to the current zoom distance: tighter
  when zoomed in, wider when zoomed out, smoothly interpolated in between.
- Only recalculates when the zoom distance actually changes — there is no
  per-frame work — so the framing stays consistent without ever touching a hot
  path.
- When disabled, your manual FOV is left exactly as the game set it.

### Context presets *(optional, off by default)*
- Applies a fixed cinematic camera bundle for the state you are in — combat,
  werewolf, stealth, mounted, or sprinting — and restores your own framing when
  you leave it.
- Entering a state is instant, but leaving one is briefly damped: a rapid
  out-and-back (combat ending and restarting a moment later) keeps the cinematic
  framing instead of snapping the camera around, so the view never jitters.
- The interaction state is the exception: entering it is briefly delayed, so
  flicking through a merchant or quick quest turn-in never pecks the camera —
  only a conversation you actually stay in reframes the shot.
- Exactly one state is active at a time, resolved by priority
  (werewolf → combat → stealth → mounted → sprint), so states never fight each
  other.
- A single global **intensity** slider scales every bundle, and each state has
  its own style choice plus an individual **intensity** slider that scales that
  state on top of the global value (0% = no effect, 100% = full style strength).
- Your pre-preset camera is snapshotted the first time a preset takes over and
  **persisted**, so a `/reloadui`, logout, or crash while a preset is active
  hands your real camera back next session instead of baking the preset's
  offsets into your settings.
- Open the game's settings while a preset is active and your camera quietly
  reverts to your real values for editing, then the preset re-applies on top of
  your changes when you close it — so tweaking FOV or distance never fights the
  active preset or gets baked into your saved framing.
- An **emergency restore** button in the settings panel instantly returns the
  camera to your control if anything ever feels stuck.

### Self-check diagnostics
- A passive reliability layer that validates the addon's own invariants and
  watches the footprint of BAV-owned tables for runaway growth, so a silent
  regression surfaces as a one-line warning instead of a mystery bug report.
- Costs nothing during play: it never runs per frame and never polls. Checks
  fire only at naturally-quiet moments (load, zone change) or on demand via
  `/bav selfcheck`, and the automatic pass stays completely silent unless
  something is actually wrong.
- Skips itself entirely while you are in combat, so a check never lands on a
  busy moment.

### Conflict resilience *(automatic safety net)*
- Because BAV hooks the game's own first-person toggle, another addon that
  drives that toggle can, in rare cases, fight it and make the view flicker
  between first and third person. BAV watches for that: if the view flips back
  and forth at a rate no human could produce, it **steps its own handling
  aside** (passes the toggle straight to the game) to break the loop.
- The backoff is fully **reversible** and touches none of your saved settings —
  it clears the moment you relog or use `/bav reset`.
- When it triggers, a single **neutral** chat notice explains what happened and
  suggests disabling addons one at a time to find the source. It never names or
  blames another addon — a hooked function cannot reliably know who called it,
  so guessing would be misleading.
- The notice can be turned off in **Settings → Diagnostics** (the safety step
  itself always runs; the toggle only controls the chat message). `/bav
  selfcheck` always reports the current backoff status.

---

## Why it's built well

- **No surprises.** Context presets stay off until you enable them, and any
  disabled module is fully inert — it registers no events, runs no polling, and
  never writes to the camera. Dynamic FOV ships on, but a single toggle returns
  the camera to exactly what the game set.
- **One source of truth for engine I/O.** All camera reads and writes go
  through a single `CameraSettings` layer that handles the engine's value
  formatting and verifies every write by reading it back. A future client
  change needs fixing in exactly one place.
- **No FOV tug-of-war.** A dedicated `FovArbiter` makes field-of-view
  precedence explicit, so dynamic FOV and context presets can never overwrite
  each other depending on load order or timing.
- **Nothing on the per-frame path.** Work happens only in response to real
  events — a zoom change, a state transition — never every frame.
- **Recovers gracefully.** The pre-preset camera snapshot is persisted, so an
  interrupted session never leaves cinematic offsets baked into your settings.
- **Catches its own regressions.** A pull-based self-check validates internal
  invariants and watches the footprint of its own tables at quiet moments,
  turning silent bugs into a single readable warning — without adding any
  per-frame cost.
- **Plays nicely with others.** BAV shares the game's first-person toggle with
  any addon that uses it. It balances the rapid same-frame toggle pairs other
  addons use to measure the camera, and if it ever detects a runaway view
  flicker it steps its own handling aside — a reversible safety net that needs
  no configuration and never blames another addon.
- **Localized** with English and Russian strings, and a clean LibAddonMenu
  settings panel.

## Architecture at a glance

The addon is split into layers with **one-way dependencies**: upper layers know
about lower ones, never the reverse. Two rules anchor the whole design — *only*
`CameraSettings` talks to the engine, and *only* `FovArbiter` decides who owns
the field of view. Everything else is a consumer of those two contracts.

```
            Settings.lua            UI + SavedVariables — wires everything
                 │ Configure(...)
   ┌─────────────┼────────────────┐
   ▼             ▼                ▼
DynamicFov   ContextPresets   Free-zoom core (BureauOfAcceptableViews.lua)
   │             │  ▲
   │             │  ╎ GetDiagnostics() — read-only    ┌──────────────┐
   │             │  └╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤  SelfCheck   │
   └──────┬──────┘                                    └──────────────┘
          ▼                                       passive observer · writes nothing

    CameraSettings          the only verified engine I/O
          │
          ▼
   GetSetting / SetSetting  raw engine API
```

`SelfCheck` deliberately sits *beside* the I/O hierarchy: it is a read-only
observer that never writes to the camera or settings. It lazily polls the other
modules' diagnostics accessors and counts the entries in BAV-owned tables, so it
depends on no one and its absence changes nothing.

## How it works

A few small maps of the moving parts. None of this is required reading to *use*
the addon — it is here for the curious and for anyone reading the source.

### State priority — only one preset wins

Context presets never fight each other. At most **one** state is active at a
time, resolved top-down by priority and gated by each state's style choice:
the first state that is both physically active *and* set to a style other than
Off wins.

```
   physical state(s) active ──▶  resolve by priority  ──▶  one winner
                                 ┌───────────────────┐
   highest  │  werewolf  ───────▶│ first active state │
            │  combat    ───────▶│ with a non-Off     │──▶ apply bundle
            │  stealth   ───────▶│ style wins; rest   │
            │  mounted   ───────▶│ are ignored        │
   lowest   │  sprint    ───────▶│                    │──▶ none? → restore
                                 └───────────────────┘      your framing
```

Werewolf deliberately outranks combat — a transformation should win even mid-fight.

### Dynamic FOV — zoom drives the lens

When enabled, your field of view tracks the zoom distance: tight when zoomed in,
wide when zoomed out, linearly interpolated between. It recalculates **only when
the distance actually changes** — never per frame — and yields to a preset hold.

```
   zoom in  ◀─────────────── distance ───────────────▶  zoom out
   │                                                            │
   ▼                                                            ▼
 narrow FOV ◀───── linear interpolation (near ↔ far) ─────▶ wide FOV
   │                                                            │
   └──────────────▶ request to FovArbiter ◀────────────────────┘
                    (applied only if no preset hold owns FOV)
```

### Snapshot & restore — surviving a crash

The first time a preset takes over, your real camera is snapshotted **and
persisted** to SavedVariables. So even a `/reloadui`, logout, or crash mid-preset
hands your genuine framing back next session — never the preset's offsets.

```
  preset takes over          session ends abruptly         next login
  ┌──────────────┐           ┌──────────────────┐          ┌──────────────┐
  │ snapshot live│           │ /reloadui · crash│          │ recover from │
  │ camera  ─────┼──persist──▶│ logout while a   │──saved──▶│ persisted    │
  │ to SavedVars │           │ preset is active │          │ snapshot,    │
  └──────────────┘           └──────────────────┘          │ then clear it│
        │                                                   └──────────────┘
        └─ back to default in-session ──▶ restore + clear ─────────┘
```

This breaks the drift cycle where a dirty (offset) camera would otherwise be
saved as the new baseline.

### Self-check — quiet until something's wrong

A pull-based reliability pass: it runs at load and zone change (or on demand via
`/bav selfcheck`), validates internal invariants, samples the footprint of
BAV-owned tables, and stays **completely silent** unless something is actually
broken. It skips itself in combat and never touches the camera.

```
   trigger (PULL only)            checks (read-only)            output
   ┌────────────────────┐        ┌────────────────────┐
   │ load / zone change  │        │ orphaned FOV hold  │       healthy
   │   → in combat? skip │───────▶│ snapshot coherence │──────▶  silence
   │ /bav selfcheck      │        │ sprint-poll leak   │
   │   → verbose report  │        │ slot leak          │       problem
   └────────────────────┘        │ footprint growth   │──────▶  one-line
                                  └────────────────────┘         warning
```

Verbose mode (`/bav selfcheck`) additionally prints footprint figures and an
explicit "all invariants OK".

## A note on AI assistance

During the development of this addon, the AI assistant Claude Opus 4.8 was
utilized in a strictly technical capacity. Its role was limited to debugging,
Lua optimization, performance tuning, and preventing potential memory leaks or
unsafe code practices. All AI-assisted code has been manually reviewed, tested,
and verified by the developer.

**P.S.** If the mere mention of AI makes you panic, this addon might not be for
you. Otherwise, rest assured: stability and performance are polished to the
highest standard, ensuring zero noticeable impact on your FPS or game memory.
